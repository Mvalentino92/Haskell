# Haskell
The problems from 99 Haskell Problems have been passed down from Prolog, to Lisp, and now Haskell. Just trying to take part in the tradition while learning Haskell.

I'll also just being throwing some random Haskell files up here, during my journey of learning the language and functional programming in general.

**rref.hs:** Solves a system of equations using Gaussian Elimination. Only works for "nice" square matrices with a unique solution. For a full implementation that works for anything, see my Java version in the JAVA repository.

**useful_functions.hs:** Functions I wrote during my Numerical Analysis class. 

**EightPuzzle.hs:** Solves the class Eight Puzzle problem using the A* algorithm. My first implementation of an example from an AI book I'm reading. Did it in Haskell, phew! It's not very efficient, but Haskell! Will most likely use Julia for the rest of the examples I do from the book.

**SetPartitions.hs:** Calculates the number of ways a set can be partitioned. This is also known as Bell Numbers. I figured it out from scratch though, before goolging to confirm.
